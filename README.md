ELLE3: ELLE's not an acronym (is a guideline)
=============================================
ELLE3 is a guideline on how to manage university community with ease. It
IS NOT a bot nor an application. This README is literally what ELLE3 is.
For the discord bot check [this repo](https://github.com/begbaj/elle3-discord-bot).
I plan to develop various utilities for ELLE3 specification implementation in the future,
but it requires a lot of time that I don't have right now.

# WORK IN PROGRESS:
everything that's written in this specification is to be considered as NOT COMPLETE, it is
still in a work in progress state and MANY things will change till it's release. If you want
to contribute in defining the specification you're very welcome. Contact me via [email](mailto:beganbajrami@gmail.com)
Also, pull request are "blindly" accepted only for **typo fixing**, while changes to the document are accepted only
if previously discussed directly with me.
Issues on github are also another good way for discussion, feel free to create one if emailing seems too formal or less
efficent.

## Introduction:
You may be wondering "why we need a guideline", and that's what this introduction is for.
If you want to get straight to the point feel free to skip this section.

ELLE3 is a "standard" (so to speak) on how to manage a very LARGE community with NO LEADERS whatsoever.
It is intended to last as long as possibile in such a way that the community can be an heritage of
former students to the new ones. It is intended to not leave all the responsability to one person
only, nor to just a few people in the institute.

Now you will be asking "how do you do that?" or maybe the answer it's obvious to you, but let me
explain why this is not such a easy problem to solve:
first of all, to build a community we need people in it, and we need to reach as many people as
possible. In many universities, there're already some little or big commuinties on instagram and
facebook (or other social networks), but often times their're centralized commuinties
(meaning there is a leader or a manager) and more often these communities are used as an advertising
point. This means that some people every now and then are making money out of something that should
be completly free (as in freedom). Its obvious that its not that easy to collaborate with these people
if you want to build something bigger or more organized and make it completly free.
BE CAREFUL, I'm not saying that making money is wrong, but some people thinks that's the main reason
to build a community for, so I enforce the idea that an ELLE3 Compliant commuinty SHOULD BE A NO-PROFFIT COMMUNITY.
So start with the idea that you are NOT getting the help of this people into building this community. Of course you can
try to, but there are no guarantees that it will work.
second, the university is (with really high chance) NOT going to take the responsibility of the
community, as on their point of view it can be something too difficult or even dangerous to manage.
Not too bad I would say, since the community is a students community managed by students, we don't
want the institute to take over this place (even tho their help may be useful).

What ELLE3 wants to build is a completly free community, without leaders, without paid advertisement
and without spam messages. It should be a place for students to share knowledge, ask for help, share interests
and make new friends. It should also let students connect with every department of the university breaking
those invisible walls between students of different courses.

## How to reach people:
Unfortunatly, this isn't so easy. If you know someone that has a big instagram page (or any social network)
you could ask their help into sharing the word of the existence of the community. But if you're not so lucky
you have to make it from the ground. Share the community to everyone you know on chat groups, in real life
and if you can afford it print some flyers with a link or a qr code to your community and spread them everywhere
where you're allowed to (probably you have to ask the permission to do so).

##### TL;DR.
There isn't a specific way on how to reach people so here is a brief list of some tips on how to do it:

1. Tell everyone you know about the existence of the community and ask them to do the same with their friends
2. Ask some popular social page to share a link or a qr code to your community (if their good people, they will
do it, otherwise don't insist on them and go for another solution)
3. Print some flyers and spread them everywhere you can (with permission)
4. If someone is already in the community, remind them to share the link every now and then but don't be annoying

## Who's in charge (who is the "leader")?
We already said that there isn't one that is actually "the leader", but it is obvious that someone
will be recognised as it (probably you, if you're the founder of the community). What I mean by "no
leader" is that there is no absolute power, no one should ever have such power on a place like this (think
of it like a place with tens of thousands of people, it has the size of a city).
But someone should have the power to enforce rules and the ideology; these people are commonly called
_administrators_, _moderators_ or even _operators_ on the internet. Let's refer to this group of people
just as admins for convenience.

Admins are those who are in charge of enforcing rules and ideology in the community.
They can take actions like muting or even banning people from the community if needed.
Also, they can make _official announcments_ when needed.
Messages can be deleted if against the rules.

But be careful, admins are not _all-powerfull_: in fact they can't take decisions on their own if
a decision is not obvious.

### What is an obvious decision?
An obvious decision is a decision thats a direct consequence of the rules and the ideology of the community.
Let's say for example that someone has posted NSFW content in a pubblic chatroom: it is obvious that the message
will be deleted and the user who posted the message will be muted for some time. Lets say that after the mute period
that user posted again some NSFW content on a public channel: here is another example of an _obvious decision_ since
it is sufficent reading the rules to know what to do (the user will be permanently muted on the community).
Lets say that someone posted a controversial topic in a public chatroom like something that is generally not agreed
by the community but still not breaking the rules itself. What can happen here?
Initially someone could say that the post is extremelly unagreeable and that contents like these should be banned
from the community, while someone else may agree with the OP (original poster). The discussin goes on for hours, with people
starting insulting eachother just for having different ideas on that topic.
In a situation like this it is difficult to take action just by following the rules since people are getting angry but
maybe it's the first time they do so and maybe they're overall some good folks on the community. Just by following the rules
some people may get muted or even banned from the community for just an episode of controversy.
Here is a situation of _not an obvious decision_. But that's just an example.
Another example is that some rules of the community are generally not accepted by the pepole and they request a change
to admins. In a situation like this it is MANDATORY to talk to the majority of admins.


Since admins are not _all-powerfull_ they can't just decide to change a rule without asking permission to everyone else.
So a system that lets admins vote is required. This way, every major decision is taken by everyone that has the power to do so.

### why not letting all people of the community vote?
Well, it is not denied to do so, but is more complicated. It is in fact prefered to have a system that lets everybody vote instead
of creating an oligarchy, but there are some limitations: not everybody will ever participate and not everybody has full knowledge
of the current state of the community. A more democratic way will let everyone that has at least some degree of activity on the
community to vote. This way you're not only creating a more democratic environment but also stimulate people into interact more often
with the community.

## Community Rules (and how to enforce them)
This section is divided in *mandatory rules* and *suggested rules*. *Mandatory rules* are those that
are required to be ELLE3 compliant.

### Mandatory Rules
1. Behaviour
1.1. Treat everyone with respect

1. Responsabilty (whether or not a member is considered responsible)

1. Penalties

### Suggested Rules
1. Content (rules regarding media and shared materials)
1. Language (what languages you're allowed to speak and where, for )



## Power managment
How to be an adminstrator
## Content Management
Where to share files and media content and what.
## Basic Services

1. sharing news that's on sutedents interests (like official announcemnts by the institute)
1. a way to discuss everything that's on students interests
1. chatrooms for every course
