ELLE3: ELLE's not an acronym (is a guideline)
=============================================
ELLE3 is a guideline on how to manage university community with ease. It
IS NOT a bot nor an application. This README is literally what ELLE3 is.
For the discord bot check [this repo](https://github.com/begbaj/elle3-discord-bot).
I plan to develop various utilities for ELLE3 specification implementation in the future,
but it requires a lot of time that I don't have right now.

## Introduction:
You may be wondering "why we need a guideline", and that's what this introduction is for.
If you want to get straight to the point feel free to skip this section.

ELLE3 is a "standard" (so to speak) on how to manage a very LARGE community with NO LEADERS whatsoever.
It is intended to last as long as possibile in such a way that the community can be an heritage of
former students to the new ones. It is intended to not leave all the responsability to one person
only, nor to just a few people in the institute.

Now you will be asking "how do you do that?" or maybe the answer it's obvious to you, but let me
explain why this is not such a easy problem to solve:
first of all, to build a community we need people in it, and we need to reach as many people as
possible. In many universities, there're already some little or big commuinties on instagram and
facebook (or other social networks), but often times their're centralized commuinties
(meaning there is a leader or a manager) and more often these communities are used as an advertising
point. This means that some people every now and then are making money out of something that should
be completly free (as in freedom). Its obvious that its not that easy to collaborate with these people
if you want to build something bigger or more organized and make it completly free.
BE CAREFUL, I'm not saying that making money is wrong, but some people thinks that's the main reason
to build a community for, so I enforce the idea that an ELLE3 Compliant commuinty SHOULD BE A NO-PROFFIT COMMUNITY.
So start with the idea that you are NOT getting the help of this people into building this community. Of course you can
try to, but there are no guarantees that it will work.
second, the university is (with really high chance) NOT going to take the responsibility of the
community, as on their point of view it can be something too difficult or even dangerous to manage.
Not too bad I would say, since the community is a students community managed by students, we don't
want the institute to take over this place (even tho their help may be useful).

What ELLE3 wants to build is a completly free community, without leaders, without paid advertisement
and without spam messages. It should be a place for students to share knowledge, ask for help, share interests
and make new friends. It should also let students connect with every department of the university breaking
those invisible walls between students of different courses.

## How to reach people:
Unfortunatly, this isn't so easy. If you know someone that has a big instagram page (or any social network)
you could ask their help into sharing the word of the existence of the community. But if you're not so lucky
you have to make it from the ground. Share the community to everyone you know on chat groups, in real life
and if you can afford it print some flyers with a link or a qr code to your community and spread them everywhere
where you're allowed to (probably you have to ask the permission to do so).

##### TL;DR.
There isn't a specific way on how to reach people so here is a brief list of some tips on how to do it:

1. Tell everyone you know about the existence of the community and ask them to do the same with their friends
2. Ask some popular social page to share a link or a qr code to your community (if their good people, they will do it, otherwise don't insist on them and go for another solution)
3. Print some flyers and spread them everywhere you can (with permission)
4. If someone is already in the community, remind them to share the link every now and then but don't be annoying
